Competition was on 9/30/22

I only attempted one problem, of which I received TLE on pretest 4.
I compared my algo to some successfully submitted java algos, and mine was the same.

So at a high level, my algo was correct. I think there were some smaller optimizations that could have been made so that
the problem would be accepted. I'll look into this again soon.
